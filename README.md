# solr-rpms

Packages [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) on EL7 (CentOS 7). The package is not built from source, but instead the already-built binary .tgz is downloaded and put into an RPM for ease of installation/upgrade.

## Quickstart

```
vagrant up # or vagrant provision if the VM is already up
ls RPMS/noarch
```
